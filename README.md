# Web-Mashup-House-Address-with-Weather-details

Using RESTFUL API services, built a web app that combined Google Maps API and GeoNames API. In this, user can click on any location on the map and the app would place a marker along with an InfoWindow displaying the location address and the current weather of that location. Also, maintained a log of recent searches.

Technologies Used: JavaScript, GeoNames API, XML, AJAX
